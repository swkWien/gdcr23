## Separation of concerns - Why? 🤔 {.smaller}

. . .

> "the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of" ([Dijkstra, 1974](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html))

. . .

> Reduce complex problems into a series of manageable layers and components.

. . .

> More degrees of freedom (to introduce changes, reuse, deployment, ...)

## Separation of concerns - Design to make our life easier! 🥳 {.smaller}

. . .

**Reduce Coupling**: Separate things that are different into separate classes.

*Coupling is measured by the number of relations between the classes.*
*That is, the coupling increases as the number of calls between classes increase or the amount of shared data is large.*

. . .

**Improve Cohesion**: Put things that do the same thing together.

*Functional, Sequential, Communicational, Procedural, Temporal, Logical, ...*

. . .

## Separation of concerns - How? ⚙️

Identify "who is responsible for what?"

Hints:

* Clarify responsibilities between `Teller` and `ShoppingCart`.
* Separate view, formatting and logic.
* What about [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) violations in `ReceiptPrinter`? ("only talk to friends")

## Extra Challenges

### Use only keyboard shortcuts, no mouse 🐭
for navigation and refactoring

### Visualize 📦
Visualize the coupling (e.g. Control / Data Coupling)

* Which concerns could you identify?
* Have you introduced Abstract Data Types (Interfaces)? If so, which?
* How many tests would you have to alter?
* Could you visualize the coupling of classes?
