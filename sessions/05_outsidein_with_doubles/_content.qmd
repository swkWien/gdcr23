# Session 4: Outside-In with test doubles {{< fa arrow-right-to-bracket >}}

<br>

Focus: separation of the system under test<br> and its collaborators 🧬

<br>

Facilitator: Adam Zielinski

---

## Separation of concerns

<br>

Motivation: often the tested unit relies on other units (**collaborators**) to fulfill its behaviour

* What's the unit under test? 🧐
* Keep code simple (fast, minimal, deterministic, ...)
* Test non-pure interfaces (indirect input / indirect output)

## Test doubles 🪢

A pattern where you replace a production object for testing purposes [^1][^2][^3]

## Test double patterns 🪢

* State verification: Fake Object, Stubs
* Behavior verification: Spy, Mock (the Sherlock Holmes of unit testing)

<!--
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
* **Fake** objects actually have working implementations, but usually take
  some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production.
* **Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test,
  usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
* **Spies** are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called.e
  One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent.
* **Mocks** objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of
  the calls they are expected to receive.

## Test doubles goes Tetris 🗼

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
```typescript
interface Bottom {

    /** Check a piece has contact with bottom */
    touches(piece: Piece): boolean

    /** Add the piece to the bottom because it has landed */
    land(piece: Piece): void

    /**
     * Check for full lines and remove the returned lines,
     * empty when no full lines there
     * count from bottom, 0 is lowest.
     */
    removeFullLines(): number[]

    /** Return max height of the different columns of bottom. */
    maximumHeight(): number

}
```
