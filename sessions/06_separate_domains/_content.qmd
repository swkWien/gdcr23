# Session 5

Focus: Separating a Domain into Bounded Contexts

Facilitator: Roland Germ [@rolgerm](https://twitter.com/rolgerm)

## Decoupling into functional Areas

* Which grouping of the domain did you identify in the 1st session today?
* How should we split a domain in functional areas?

---

## Domain and Bounded Contexts

* A Domain consists the whole model
* Large models are divided into subdomains or bounded contexts driven by separating business needs
* A bounded context is a projection of the problem space into the solution space
* Code that combines two bounded contexts gets convoluted because it's mixing two separate vocabularies together ("Martin Fowler").

## Tips

* Start by creating directories for the separate domains.
* Decide which code belongs to a domain and move it to the right location (this includes moving methods/functions)
* Create your anti-corruption-layers between the domains (start with the simplest).

## Extra Challenge: Don't share the Product between domains

The Product is somehow a shared model. But in future the Product could be enhanced and each domain needs its own view or selected data of a Product.

* What is needed to identify a product in a domain?
* Which domain does the Printer belong to?

* Which domains did you create ?
* Which dependencies do you have finally?
* How did name the name the ports and adapters?
* What constructs hindered you?
* What do we achieve by applying a hexagonal architecture
